## Introduction
This project contains a buggy code of the Six Men's Morris Game.

### Goal
The main goal is to identify the bugs in the program, through unit testing and fix them.

### Testing Phase
The main step in figuring out the bugs in the program was extensive testing. Unit Testing was performed using Google Test, 
with test cases being developed for various edge cases, like wrapping, changing player moves, declaring the winner.

### Debugging Phase
After preliminary testing, debugging phase began, targetting more subtle issues with the code and for added robustness. Use of
`gdb` was preferred for this phase.

### Completion Phase
Once all the tests were in place, the work was to fix all the errors in the code and to nake the game playable. Various errors 
were fixed and user testing was carried out to make sure the game was smooth.
